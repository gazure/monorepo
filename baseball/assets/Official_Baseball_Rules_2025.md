## Foreword

This code of rules governs the playing of baseball games by professional teams of Major League Baseball and any league within the professional development league system operated by Major League Baseball in which Minor League Clubs are assigned to compete.

We recognize that many amateur and non-professional organizations play their games under professional rules and we are happy to make our rules available as widely as possible. It is well to remember that specifications as to fields, equipment, etc., may be modified to meet the needs of each group.

Money fines, long-term suspensions and similar penalties imposed by this code are not practicable for amateur groups, but officers and umpires of such organizations should insist on strict observance of all the rules governing the playing of the game.

## Important Notes

### Note 1: Rule Reorganization (2014)
The Playing Rules Committee, at its December 2014 meeting, voted to reorganize and recodify the Official Baseball Rules into a more logical and organized manner. No wording or language was changed (other than the amendments made for that year); only the order and placement of the rules were modified. In this edition Comments to the Official Rules are highlighted in a shaded box rather than being printed in smaller typeface as had been the case prior to 2015.

### Note 2: Case Book Integration (1977)
The Playing Rules Committee, at its December 1977 meeting, voted to incorporate the Notes/Case Book/Comments section directly into the Official Baseball Rules at the appropriate places. Basically, the Case Book interprets or elaborates on the basic rules and in essence have the same effect as rules when applied to particular sections for which they are intended.

This arrangement is designed to give quicker access to any written language pertaining to an Official Rule and does not require a reader to refer to different sections of the Official Baseball Rules book in considering the application of a particular rule.

Case Book material in this edition are in shaded boxes and are labeled as "Comment."

## Summary of Rule Changes for 2025

- **Rule 5.02(c) Amendment:** Specify the awards given to the batter and runner(s) if an illegally positioned infielder fields a batted ball.

- **Rule 5.02(c) Penalty Comment:** Added to reflect that the offensive manager may elect to accept the result of the play rather than the penalty that occurred due to an illegally positioned infielder fielding a batted ball.

- **Section 9.00 Amendments:** Updated rules within "The Official Scorer" to account for official scoring of batters who are awarded first base due to a shift restriction violation and of fielders who commit shift restriction violations.
